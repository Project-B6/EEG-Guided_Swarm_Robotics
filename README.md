# EEG-Guided Swarm Robotics
The EEG-Guided Swarm Robotics project focuses on controlling and coordinating multiple drones using brain signals. By integrating neural signal processing with machine learning, it enables real-time, hands-free navigation of robotic swarms. EEG-based inputs allow adaptive decision-making, optimizing task execution in dynamic environments.
